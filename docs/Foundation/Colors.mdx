## Primary Colors
Primary palette is comprised of neutrals, white, and blue. These colors are present across most touch points from marketing to product.

## Light neutrals
Light neutrals are helpful for offsetting content in a primarily white layout without losing warmth and cleanliness, and are therefore often used as a background color for web components.
