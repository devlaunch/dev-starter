## Game Rules

## Game Play

At the start of each match, both players are randomly given 4 crew members to from their decks and chose which of these will participate in each of the match’s four rounds.

Players (and individual crew) gain experience after each match.

Crew gain new abilities and increase in power as they rank up while players gain access to higher level channels and earn ‘coins’ with which to purchase new coins or items.

### Character's card

When you sign up, you'll receive your first 8 Characters free of charge. At each level, a character is defined by its Power (P) and Damage (D). Some characters also get a special ability when they reach a certain level.

All of this information is indicated on the character's card.

Level 1 - 2: 500xp

Level 2 - 3: 1500xp

Level 3 - 4: 3000xp

A player gains XP when they level up their cards, hence why cards that aren't fully upgraded sell for more coins on the Market.
